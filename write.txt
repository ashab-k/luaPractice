Hello, this is line one.
Last but one line.
Lua is a lightweight scripting language.

How do they compare with generator-style iterators? Both styles have approximately the same overhead:
one function call per iteration. On the one hand, it is easier to write the iterator with true iterators (although
we can recover this easiness with coroutines, as we will see in the section called “Coroutines as Iterators”).
On the other hand, the generator style is more flexible. First, it allows two or more parallel iterations.
(For instance, consider the problem of iterating over two files comparing them word by word.) Second,
it allows the use of break and return inside the iterator body. With a true iterator, a return returns from
the anonymous function, not from the function doing the iteration. For these reasons, overall I usually
prefer generators.th    tabs.
